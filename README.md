# Linked list
Linked list is an one of the most common data structure.

Linked list's store elements sequentially, but donâ€™t store the elements contiguously like an array.

Insertions and deletions in linked list's takes O(1) time only. But reading takes O(n) time, because unlike arrays linked list's can't do random access. Linked list's can only do sequential access.
